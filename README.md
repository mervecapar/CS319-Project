# CS319-Project
Run To Live is a kind of survival game. While the player aims to run away from virus and protect himself, virus transmits itself to kill the player. In the game there is a viral virus that infects lots of people in the world and kills them in some time. The player is going to try to run away from the virus until this virus stops its transmission through the map. There will be a map including many countries. In every turn, they will move between countries until the virus is destroyed. There will be some inputs in the very beginning of the game which will indicate the difficulty of it. Some of the inputs are the infection risk, the killing risk, the destroying possibility and the immune people. At the same time, there will be some rules like in every turn, players can just move 1 step, if they do not have any power-up to go further. In every country, we will show the number of dead people killed by virus and the number of doctors in that country to indicate the risks. According to these, the virus aims to kill the player, while he tries to run from the virus.
